# my nixos configuration :3

I didn't make this config for other people to just be able to use/copy. 
But you're allowed to if you want of course, I won't stop you.
There may be some useful parts in the clusterfuck that I made and maybe I'll try to make it nicer sometime.  

## My systems

I have three active systems, my pc (lambdaOS), my laptop (muOS) and my server (nuOS).
Both my pc and laptop are running mainly hyprland with plasma mostly just
there because I didn't want to setup sddm themes myself.  

the server has some nginx helper functions so I can easily add more proxies for random websites I make.

I hope you have a great rest of your day.
